#### Click on the Deploy phase of the pipeline

* This will navigate you to the deployment status for the ECS service

* **Step 1:** will deploy the replacement task set based on the `taskdef.json` and new image created by the build phase
* **Step 2:** will setup the new tasks and enable the test listener on the port `8080`
* Once step 2 is completed, open the service in your browser on the Load Balancer Test listener port `8080`

Here is the command to get the url:

```bash
echo "http://$ALB_DNS:8080"
```

You will see the demo application with a changed background colour of green.

* **Step 3:** initiates the traffic shifting from Blue to Green deployment
    * We have a seamless traffic shifting from blue to green using the deployment configuration - `CodeDeployDefault.ECSLinear10PercentEvery1Minutes`. We shift 10 percent of traffic every minute until all traffic is shifted
    * Once completed, port `80` will display the **green deployment**
 
Here is the command to get the url:

```bash
echo "http://$ALB_DNS"
```

* **Step 4** is where the old task set is retained for 10 minutes. This time period is configurable via the CDK stack
* **Step 5** will terminate the original task set

We have completed a successful blue/green deployment. Let's now do rollback of a failed deployment
