In the Cloud9 workspace, run the following commands:

## Install and setup prerequisites

```
# Install prerequisite packages
sudo yum -y install jq gettext
```
`jq` is a tool that can be used to extract and transform data held in JSON files.

The `gettext` package includes the `envsubst` utility, which can be used to substitute the values of environment variables into an input stream.

We will use these tools, along with the Linux utility `sed`, to insert or replace attribute values in various files throughout the workshop. This avoids the need for manual text editing wherever possible.

```bash
# Setting environment variables required to communicate with AWS API's via the cli tools
echo "export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r .region)" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export AWS_REGION=\$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
