# Configure CloudWatch Container Insights for your ECS cluster

{{< youtube hMqAApYgkaM >}}

### Introduction

In this chapter we will learn about setting up Monitoring for your ECS environment through Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights.

You can use [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html) to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. Container Insights also provides diagnostic information, such as container restart failures, to help you isolate issues and resolve them quickly.
